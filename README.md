# Automate Image Building Using Packer

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

### Feature:
We will be creating a custom AMI using Packer and then launch an instance with this AMI using terraform.

**[Packer](https://www.packer.io/) is a simple yet extremely powerful tool to automate the build of machine images.**

### The code is built using the following versions:
| Application | Version |
| ------ | ------ |
| Packer | v1.8.5 |
| Terraform | v1.3.6 |

**The purpose and method of operation are well explained in my Medium [article](https://medium.com/@ssksreehari/automate-image-building-using-packer-2938b624d7d4).**
**Kindly take a look.**
